This is my personal nvim config.

I do not take any credit for of the plugins or configurations used - these are all
default configs (just copied over, so that it's easier to change what I want), or snippets
from random articles on the Internet (if that's the case, then it's likely for "CRED:"
link for be somewhere around).

Organization, lua codestyle, and bare necessity plugins were inspired by [this playlist][nvim-from-scratch].
Can't recommend it enough.
